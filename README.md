# Supposedly the best version of MSMC_clustering. 
This is because this version of MSMC_clustering is easier to use and read than the other abominations that I have lying around. 
I will be using this version in my webapp.

I've been using this a submodule for my webapp and analyses to have a central version of my clustering code.
